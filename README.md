I created a smart fire extinguisher. When it detects that there is a fire, the alarms go off and the water pump turns on. It also sends a radio message with the temperature to the second micro:bit, which is connected to the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi receives the message, and then sends notification to your phone with current temperature. The temperature is expressed in Fahrenheit as well as Centigrade. You can also specify the name of the room where the smart fire extinguisher is, and the notification will also tell which room it is in. 

I created this project because I heard about the wildfires in Australia and California. My smart fire extinguisher is going to help communities if there is a fire in someoneâ€™s house. It going to extinguishes the fire by itself, turning the alarm off, and by sending the notification to your phone. The notification can also be used to alert emergency services, like the fire Department.
